          Racism and bias. 
            It's a global issue, but over the summer there is a movement that is on the rise demanding police reform and justice for African American communities. 
            Racism and police brutality aren't only present in the US, but the police force in the US does have a racist start.   
            So many African Americans today have an uneasy and frankly bad relationship with the police. This isn't consequential, 
            police for decades have been using their authority to control and alter the lives of so many POC people. 
            In the US there is a huge interconnected web of police brutality, the mass incarceration system, poverty, and race. 
            Almost every single year there are protests, they have been happening all throughout the two thousands, 
            but politicians seem to ignore the public's pleas for reform and change. Almost for a decade, year in and year out, 
            we've been watching African Americans die in the hands of law enforcement. 
            This summer due to the murder of George Floyd there have been riots and protests not only in the United States but also globally.

        <p class="info__p">
            The thing is police have never been courageous, brave, or on the side of justice for African americans.
            The constitution of the United states, 
            says that everyone is granted freedom and justice but in actuality how much of that is true for people of color? 
            So when did this happen this fear of the police in communities of color?
        </p>
        <p class="info__p fade-in">  
            In the US police were created in the 1700 hundreds to track runaway slaves. 
            That was the beginning of a system that has tormented African American communities for decades.  
            Then the slaves were freed 1863 and the 13th amendment ensured that. Although this may have seemed like a good idea, 
            slave owners in the south needed another source of free labor. Slaves did most if not all of the heavy labor back then and did it for free. 
            So there were no slaves due to the civil war and huge gap in labor that needed to be filled. Slavery was abolished be the 13th amendment, 
            but there was a loophole. It read that it would abolish slavery and unvoluntary servitude, ecxept as punishment for a crime. 
            So all throughout the nineteenth century the police were called on black people over nothing. Millions went from slave to prison worker. 
            An agenda was pushed that African Americans were more dangerous and needed harsher treatment. 
            When Black people wanted to move to white neighborhoods and integrate, the police were almost always called. 
            Rights that they should have had were stripped away such as economic, political and social freedoms. 
            These ways of expressions were punished and people of color were jailed for the smallest things.

        <p class="info__p fade-in"> 
            This has been happening for years and it got even worse after president Nixon war on drugs. 
            In the 1970s there were two things that concerned the American government : hippies and black people.  
            That was said by one of Nixon's top advisors, 
            he then added :"You understand what I'm saying? We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or black, 
            but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin. And then criminalizing both heavily,
            we could disrupt those communities, we could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, 
            break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. 
            Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did." 
            At the time Nixon was against two things the anti war hippies and the African Americans who were demanding their human rights.  
            Drugs were heavily criminalized during this time and he enforced that the new sentencing would be two to ten years for possession of marijana, 
            this was of course to jail the hippies. After that the government had to find a way of jailing black people. So what did they do?  
            During the crack epidemic in the 1990s and 80s there were even more reforms. There were many differences in cocaine and which was more expensive and better quality. 
            Powder cocaine was mainly used in middle to upper class white neighborhoods.  While crack cocaine was mainly used in inner cities by minority communities, 
            so the jail sentencing and punishment were much higher. This disproportionately affected African American communities. 
            After people convicted of a crime they are no longer able to vote, so this process is all deliberately set up to silence black communities.

        <p class="info__p fade-in">
            This can be seen today with the police disproportionately arresting balck and latino people. 
            Their sentencing time tends to be longer. Why you might wonder, well it's because the justice system is also racially biased and corrupt. 
            Today many people strike out against racism towards black and latino communities. 
            Many people from all kinds of racial backgrounds have joined together to fight a mutual enemy: racism.  
            Today thousands of people show their support by showing up to protests and donating to organizations. The deaths of Breanna Tayor, 
            George Floyd and Ahmad Aurbery have all happened over the summer. 
            As most of us know there has been global outrage, with many still fighting for the justice of Breonna Taylor.

            There are many ways you can help fight racism and police brutality. 
          The first step is to effectively recognize racism and acknowledge that certain people get different treatment and certain privileges. 
          Learning more about racism in the past and present is also a key step in understanding this problem. When you know a lot about a topic, 
          you can connect better with it and feel more passionate towards it. 
          Hearing out people of color on their experiences and feelings about racism and police brutality. 
          When listening to African Americans about their thoughts on racism do not be rude. Never try to excuse or undermine their experiences. 
          Whenever you hear anything racist around you, you have to confront it. Don't stay silent just because it's more comfortable and convenient for you. 
          Try to hear different perspectives, listen to friends and family. When people around you may be racist, 
          try your best to talk to them, 
          even if it can be very hard. 
          If you have siblings or children that are young try and educate them about racism and teach them to recognize and understand this issue.  
          Take part in protests and organizations that fight for justice and reform.
