            An interview was held and we asked the person what they thought about
            police brutality. The main thing was that police sometimes have to be more
            aggressive towards some stubborn people that had maybe done something
            wrong. Police have to be more educated about how to handle these things.
            There should be better weapons for the police that do not kill the people
            and will only get them into the car if they maybe donâ€™t want to. It was
            not said that the police were in the right with the George Floyd
            situation, but that the police could have handled it so much differently.
            George had maybe done something wrong but the police were in the wrong
            killing George and he had said that he would get in the car and that he
            couldn't breathe. She said that police brutality happens all over the
            world but not everyone acknowledges it. There is no one to help in some of
            these countries and there is no one to do something like the BLM movement.

          <p class="nichola-interview__p">
            She said that it is mostly noticed in America for the reason that there
            are a lot more famous things and people in America. People mostly speak
            out about these things in America and not in other countries. When she was
            asked about the George Floyd incident she said that she also felt violated
            just because it shocks her that humans will do this to each other.
          </p>
          <p class="nichola-interview__p">
            She said that racism and police brutality is something that has to be
            addressed in the world because it is one of the worst problems at this
            moment in the world. She said that the police should not have as much
            power as they have today. Going into George Floyd she said that she
