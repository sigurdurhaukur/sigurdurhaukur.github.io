      <h4 class="inter__h4">How would you define police brutality?</h4>
      <p class="inter__p">When the police goes too far in missions.</p>

      <h4 class="inter__h4">
        Do you think police brutality is biased and/or racist?
      </h4>
      <p class="inter__p">Yes, up to a point. .</p>

      <h4 class="inter__h4">Do you think the police should have guns?</h4>
      <p class="inter__p">
        I think the police should have access to guns, but not wear them
        everyday.
      </p>

      <h4 class="inter__h4">
        How far is too far in context of police brutality?
      </h4>
      <p class="inter__p">That depends entirely on context and environment.</p>

      <h4 class="inter__h4">How would you solve police brutality?</h4>
      <p class="inter__p">
        More training and clearer work policy. Bodycams are also a solution.
      </p>

      <h4 class="inter__h4">
        Do you think you are in danger of police brutality?
      </h4>
      <p class="inter__p">No, I think not.</p>

      <h4 class="inter__h4">
        Do you think the <i>Black Lives Matter</i> movement affects police
        brutality?
      </h4>
      <p class="inter__p">Yes, I hope so. Â </p>
