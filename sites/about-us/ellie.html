        I'm Eleanor Yerkin and I'm fourteen years old and live in Reykjavik
        Iceland. I am an American citizen, but I've lived in forgein countries
        my whole life. I have lived in Russia, San Salvador, Panama and
        Kyrgyzstan. I moved to Iceland at the beginning of the year, after
        living in Moscow for four years. For four years I went to Russian school
        and I am now fluent in Russian. My father is originally from Kazakhstan
        and my mother is American with norweigan and ojibwe roots. I currently
        live with my brother Aidyn, sister Evangeline and mother. My father
        temporarily works and lives in the US, he is with my dog and grandma. In
        my spare time I like to read, hike, kayak, play soccer, play basketball
        and watch movies with

        I believe that this is a very important issue that affects everyone
        around the world, but it is very evident that the US needs to focus on
        this problem and face it head on. Inequality seems to be everywhere,
        around each corner of the world. These problems need to be addressed by
        the government and media instead of being ignored for another couple of
        months until another person of color dies in the hands of law
        enforcement. Globally, from South Africa to Moscow, police aggression
        and the profiling of minorities is a huge issue. For me this problem hit
        very close to home. When I lived in Moscow my father was seen as someone
        who was supposed to be dangerous. In public places such as: the mall,
        the metro, shops, markets and grocery stores he was always followed by
        police. In some instances he was stopped by police, searched and
        questioned due to him looking “suspicious.” Racism is a huge issue in
        Russia along with: Islamophobia, sexism, homophobia, antisemitism and
        transphobia. Many friends of mine have made antisemetic jokes and
        remarks, they have also said horrible things about Black people and the
        lgbtq community. This is seen as a cultural norm in Russia and isn't
        considered wrong or ignorant.
