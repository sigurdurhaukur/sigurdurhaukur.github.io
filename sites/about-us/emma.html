        Hi, my name is Emma. I am thirteen years old and Iâ€™m from Iceland. I
        have lived in Iceland for my whole life but I have visited many
        countries such as Slovenia, Italy, the USA, and England. I am fluent in
        English and Icelandic. I live with my mother in Reykjavik. I have played
        the violin for 10 years and practice at the college of music in Iceland.
        My hobbies include playing the violin, playing the ukulele, playing the
        piano, knitting, and drawing.

        I believe that police brutality and overall, extreme racism is one of the biggest problems in our world today. I think the core cause of the inequality and the reason why so many people including police officers are treating others so unfairly is because of the environment so many were in during their childhood. If their parents would use racial slurs or discriminate against colored people in front of their children, they will grow up doing the same things their parents did.
