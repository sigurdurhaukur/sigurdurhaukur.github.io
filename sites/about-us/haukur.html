        <p class="about__p">
            As you already know or have guessed, my name is Haukur. 
            I live in Reykjavik and I am a sirius swimming athlete, 
            but during the pandemic it was difficult to swim because the pool was closed. 
            I know how to play the violin and I am going through a Celtic phase. (it's driving my family crazy)
            When I am not at school or not listening or playing some Celtic tunes and melodies I practice my programming skills. 
            They made this magnificent website &#128512;

        <p class="about__p">
            After reasearching police brutality and its impact on society, 
            I gained a new perspective, 
            a perspective that is larger than a frozen &#129398; island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean can give. 
            It is the fact that for many years the police have discriminated against and abused certain types of people 
            for many years and dispite all the efforts that the community has given the brutality of the police still remains. 
            I find it so disturbing &#129314; that the force that is supposed to protect us only protects some of us. I hope that this will soon change.
